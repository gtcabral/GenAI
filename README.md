RAG is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. We will implement the RAG using the Langchain framework, OpenAI LLM. We will use Pinecone, Wikipedia , and DuckDuckGo for internet search as external sources.
